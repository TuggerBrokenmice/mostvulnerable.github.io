This is a list of developers that have been hit with a **watering hole attack** or _will be_, and provide _no authentication_ for their software. Some of the software in this list is critical backup software that runs as _root_ to clone disks, like _SuperDuper!_.

_Backup software is the ultimate target of the watering hole attack_.

> Watering hole is a computer attack strategy, in which the victim is a particular group (organization, industry, or region).
> In this attack, the attacker guesses or observes which websites the group often uses and infects one or more of them with malware.
> Eventually, some member of the targeted group gets infected.
>
> Relying on websites that the group trusts makes this strategy efficient, even with groups that are resistant to spear phishing and other forms of phishing.
